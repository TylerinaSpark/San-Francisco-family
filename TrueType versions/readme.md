This TrueType version is tweaked and optimized for Windows version, it is sharper and more legible than OpenType (OTF) version (especially on low resolution screens) even the font size is small due to better hinting, therefore, using tools to convert OTF to TTF may not produce accurate results because OTF may not have font hinting metadata.  
The OTF version is blurrier and less legible on Windows if the font size is small; however, the OTF version has more functions than the TTF one and is usually prefered if the font is large enough. macOS and Linux have different font rendering techniques than Windows so OTF is usually the prefered option. Some Windows apps do not support OTF.
